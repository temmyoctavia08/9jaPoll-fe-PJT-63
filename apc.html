        <h3>ALL PROGRESSIVE CONGRESS</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="party-about">Formed in February 2013, the party is the result of a merger of Nigeria's three largest opposition parties â€“ the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), the All Nigerians Peoples Party (ANPP), a faction of the
        All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) and the new PDP - a faction of then ruling People's Democratic Party. Ironically, less than 2 years before the party's historic victory in the 2015 elections, Messrs. Annie Okonkwo, Tom Ikimi and Ibrahim Shekarau
        resigned from the party and joined the PDP. The party received approval from the nation's Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on 31 July 2013 to become a political party and subsequently withdrew the operating licenses of the three
        parties that merged (the ACN, CPC and ANPP). The current president of the country, Muhammadu Buhari is from this political party.
