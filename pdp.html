        <h3>PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC PARTY</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="party-about">Founded in August 1998 by members of numerous groups and organizations, including the groups known as G-18 and G-34. The party, which has a broad political base, supports economic deregulation, human rights, and greater funding for health care and
        education, among other goals. In preparation for the election after Abacha's death in June 1998, political parties including the PDP were formed. Alex Ekwueme, a former vice president of the country, was the first party chairman, and Jerry Gana
        was the first party secretary. The party had a broad membership drawn from traditional chiefs, academics, and businessmen and proved especially popular with the army, as some 100 retired senior officers joined, including Olusegun Obasanjo, a former
        military leader of Nigeria (1976–79) who joined the party soon after its inception. Under his guidance the PDP quickly became the country’s dominant party.
