    <p class="party-about">The Social Democratic Party of Nigeria, commonly known as the SDP, is a centre-left political party in Nigeria. It was created by former military head of state Ibrahim Babangida via a democracy project meant to form two detribalized political parties
        - one slightly to the left and one to the right. During the Nigerian Third Republic it was seen as a moderate party attractive to young radical intellectuals and socialists. In its manifesto, it called for concerted efforts to improve welfare
        and fight for social justice. After 13 prospective parties were banned by the administration of Ibrahim Babangida in 1989, some of the associations decided to re-align. The People's Front of Nigeria, People's Solidarity Party, and the Nigerian
        Labor Party emerged to form the core constituency of the new SDP. The leadership was mostly dominated by Northern Nigerians. </p>
